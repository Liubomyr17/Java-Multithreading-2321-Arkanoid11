Another Canvas will need two methods, write them.
a) clear () method
This method will clear the matrix so that you can draw on it again.
You can simply reinitialize the matrix with an empty array of the correct dimension.
b) print () method
This method draws a matrix on the screen.
Here you have to figure it out yourself: displaying a character set is not so difficult.

Requirements:
1. In the Canvas class, the void clear () method must be created without parameters.
2. The void print () method with no parameters must be created in the Canvas class.
3. The clear method should clear the matrix array.
4. The print method should display the contents of the matrix array.
